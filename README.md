# Vagrant-LEMP-16.04

## Introduction	

I hatched this project from need of an all-in-one Ubuntu 16.04 LEMP Vagrant Box which I could use on my projects.

With this box you will get the full LEMP Stack (Ubuntu 16.04, Nginx, MySQL and PHP), all nicely configured to work properly together.

- Default IP: **10.10.10.1:8000** and **10.10.10.1:4443**
- Default SSH Port: **2222**
- Linux Login: **Ubuntu** / **vagrant**
- MySQL Login: **root** / **root**

The php-setup is prepared to run LimeSurvey out of the box, so just copy this repository into the LimeSurvey bas and everything should work out of the box.
Also on upping the container limesurvey gets pulled into the webroot directory. It should be working out of the box

**Warning: Please do not use this for production environments, as it contains insecurities (basic passwords, PHP configs) and is only intended as a development environment.**
